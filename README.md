# dparse

**ATTENTION: PROJECT INCOMPLETE**

This is an attempt at rolling my own parser for the Object Pascal language as used by Borland/Inprise/Embarcadero Delphi in the style of the parser I created for the [Strato](https://github.com/stijnsanders/strato) project.

It is very incomplete. It does not connect with anything else. Data is stored in an SQLite database which _could_ be used for analysis, but the plans for anything like that are even less materialized than any plans I have with the parser itself.

For now it serves as a proof-of-concept that it could be done, and as a test-bed that there's merit to this way of storing an AST.
